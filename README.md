Spotify Browser 

This project is an Angular web application that allows users to explore the music available on Spotify, a popular music streaming app. The application communicates with a backend server written in Node.js/Express, which handles authentication via OAuth and communicates with the Spotify API.

The goal of this project is to gather data from an API and develop a frontend interface that displays the data. Angular is used to create a webpage and make HTTP requests to the backend server to trigger API calls.
